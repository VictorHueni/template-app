# Regex patterns that indicate a false positive
# These patterns identify obviously fake/demo credentials
regexes = [
    # JWT tokens ending with "demo-signature" are fake
    '''demo-signature$''',
    
    # Tokens with subjects containing "demo-user" are fake
    '''demo-user''',

# Additional notes:
# - Real secrets should NEVER be committed to version control
# - Production tokens come from environment variables or secret management systems
# - This config will be updated when proper secret management (Vault/etc) is implemented
